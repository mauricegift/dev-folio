### Developer Portfolio(DevFolio)

Animated with smooth interactivity portfolio for developers, all device responsive.

- I think all you need to edit can be found in the **[/src/services](https://github.com/mauricegift/dev-folio/tree/main/src/services)** folder
- You can use **[Gifted CDN](https://cdn.giftedtech.co.ke)** for easy image/file uploads to obtain urls
- Then deploy to **[Vercel.com](https://vercel.com)** for free
- Visit Deployed Output **[Here](https://me.giftedtech.co.ke)**
- The website's default theme is dark because I'm not good with light theme but you can change.

### ToDo
- Add cv download link to menu/sidebar and header
